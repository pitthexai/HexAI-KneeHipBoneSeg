# HexAI-KneeHipBoneSeg
## A Fully-annotated Imaging Dataset to Promote Fair and Generalized Medical Image Segmentation in Orthopedics 
<p align="justify">Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have revolutionized medical imaging informatics, specifically in semantic segmentation tasks. While these models have shown promising accuracy across a variety of tasks, their performance is bounded by the availability and amount of ground-truth data. Moreover, some of the main challenges in the domain of medical imaging informatics is ensuring the AI models' fairness regarding sex, ethnicity, and race for example, plus AI generalizability over a variety of data sources. This contribution aims to address these issues by introducing the HexAI-KneeHipBoneSeg imaging dataset, a meticulously fully-annotated segmentation dataset from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset, focusing on hip and knee bony anatomy segmentation using plain radiographs. The HexAI-KneeHipBoneSeg dataset enables AI and clinical researchers to develop accurate models and evaluate the robustness of their models to unbiased segmentation and domain shift between different bony anatomy structures. The current dataset is freely and publicly available at <a href="https://github.com/pitthexai/HexAI-KneeHipBoneSeg" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>

### Value of the Data:
+ <p align="justify"><strong>Research Advancement:</strong> he HexAI-KneeHipBoneSeg dataset is a comprehensive resource created specifically to advance semantic segmentation tasks focused on knee and hip bony structures. The HexAI-KneeHipBoneSeg dataset is a tool for researchers designed to facilitate the training of more robust and accurate models in medical image semantic segmentation.</p>
+ <p align="justify"><strong>Immense Coverage:</strong> The HexAI-KneeHipBoneSeg dataset is a comprehensive collection featuring two distinct sets of medical images: Knee-bony anatomy and Hip-bony anatomy. The dataset represents a diverse set of subjects, across multiple demographics such sex and race.</p>
+ <p align="justify"><strong>Invaluable Information:</strong> The process of annotating medical images for segmentation is both time-consuming and costly. The challenges of the annotation task have led to a scarcity of comprehensive datasets in the field of medical image semantic segmentation and consequently developing deep-learning models that typically require vast amounts of data becomes a very challenging task. The HexAI-KneeHipBoneSeg dataset, annotated using a comprehensive pipeline, provides a valuable resource for Hip and Knee bony anatomy image segmentation that not only empowers researchers to develop accurate models but also enables them to assess the robustness of their models across different anatomical structures. </p>
+ <p align="justify"><strong>Open Access for Scientific Research:</strong> Leveraging the HexAI-KneeHipBoneSeg dataset can significantly contribute to the understanding and diagnosis of osteoarthritis by enabling precise segmentation of knee and hip bony structures. This has the potential to accelerate research efforts focused on early detection, intervention, and monitoring of osteoarthritis-related complications.</p>
+ <p align="justify"><strong>Promoting AI Fairness:</strong> he dataset is designed to foster fairness in AI models by providing a diverse and fully-annotated collection of knee and hip bony anatomy images. Addressing potential biases related to sex and race is of paramount importance in achieving equitable performance across different patient populations. HexAI-KneeHipBoneSeg thus contributes to the development of models that exhibit robustness and fairness in their predictions.  </p>
+ <p align="justify"><strong>Benchmarking and Evaluation:</strong> HexAI-KneeHipBoneSeg, derived from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset [1], offers a benchmark for assessing the performance of AI models in the segmentation of hip and knee bony structures using plain radiographs. The dataset enables researchers to evaluate the accuracy of their models against a gold-standard reference, advancing transparency and facilitating direct comparisons across different computational strategies. </p>
+ <p align="justify"><strong>Advancing Osteoarthritis Research:</strong> Leveraging the HexAI-KneeHipBoneSeg dataset can significantly contribute to the understanding and diagnosis of osteoarthritis by enabling precise segmentation of knee and hip bony structures. This has the potential to accelerate research efforts focused on early detection, intervention, and monitoring of osteoarthritis-related complications. </p>
